# RandomPassGenerator

This project involves a C++ program designed to generate random passwords efficiently and securely, without relying on external libraries. By utilizing an improved random number generator (std::mt19937) and a uniform distribution, the program generates passwords with alphanumeric characters (0-9, A-Z). The password length is determined by the user.

This approach ensures stronger and more random passwords compared to standard implementations. The generator's seed is based on the current time, providing higher variability. Users simply input the desired length, and the program instantly generates a strong, random password suitable for various applications requiring robust security.
